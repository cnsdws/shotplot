This website (www.shotplot.net) is for collecting scoring data from service rifle competitions and provides a ballistics analytical capability that will review plotted data and make windage (left/right) and elevation (up/down) corrections to bring ballistic patterns to the center of the target. 

The objective of the website is to collect historical shot information (range, windage, elevation and placement of the shot,) analyze it based on an algorithm and provide feedback to the shooter so that they may make adjustments for their next match. 

This capability will allow competitive shooters of any skill to improve, but will especially be useful to novice and intermediate marksmen.

Signup can be done at www.shotplot.net/signup.

After credentials are established, Matches can be created and then Firestrings shot at the matches can be created. To use the ballistic analyzer tool, select "view details" from a firestring once it is created.

The website is based on a Laravel PHP framework and uses a MySQL database.
